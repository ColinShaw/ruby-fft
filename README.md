# FFTs in Ruby

This is demonstration code related to FFT theory and implementation. This was used in a presentation for Computer Science Club. 
It is basically an example of a DFT and very concise FFT in Ruby.  The FFT is recursive, which is not an efficient method for
computing it.  For that you need to using fancy indexing with iteration.  The purpose of this implementation is to demonstrate
the simple form of recursion for the FFT.
